# algoritHm
An attempt to implement a bunch of algorithms in Haskell, in an attempt to study for both the courses [EDAN40 (Functional programming)](https://cs.lth.se/edan40/) and [EDAF05 (Algorithms, data structures, and complexity)](https://cs.lth.se/edaf05/) at LTH, at the same time... 

Some of this code is also relevant to [EDAF95 (Basics of Functional Programming)](https://cs.lth.se/edaf95/) :)

## How to run
Install Stack, and all the Haskell prerequisites, then run ``stack test`` in the root directory of this repository to execute the tests. The ``app`` directory is untouched, so you can't execute it straight up yet.

You can also use ``ghci``, loading the parts by using ``:l <file-name>``, then running the methods as you desire to.
